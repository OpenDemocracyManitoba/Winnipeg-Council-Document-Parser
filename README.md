## Winnipeg Council Documents Parser

Extracts data from [Winnipeg Council Dispositions posted to data.winnipeg.ca](https://data.winnipeg.ca/Council-Services/Public-Meeting-Disposition-Word-Format/hsbq-sj6t).

Dispositions are prepared by the City Clerks' Department using Microsoft Word. Tables are used to structure the council meeting information. 

Word saves files in docx format, which is actually a zip file full of XML. The [disposition.rb](https://github.com/OpenDemocracyManitoba/Winnipeg-Council-Document-Parser/blob/master/disposition.rb) extraction script uses the [docx gem](https://github.com/chrahunt/docx) to load up the disposition tables.

Ruby methods exist to extract:

* Council Meeting Attendance (done)
* Reports to Council (done)
* Bylaws (done)
* Motions (done)
* Recorded Votes (in progress)
* Conflict of Interest Declarations (to do)
