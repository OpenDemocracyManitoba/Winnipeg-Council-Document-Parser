In the present case, CN Rail has an additional obligation due to the existence of a legal agreement entered into by the City and CN Rail’s predecessors, The Canadian Northern Railway Company and The Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Company, in 1930, which was ratified by Council as By-law 13988 on July 7, 1930.  This agreement required that CN Rail construct a 50 foot wide two-lane overhead bridge structure including two 5 foot sidewalks at Waverley Street.  Over the years, land development in the area and increased traffic demand at this site has resulted in a two-lane overhead bridge not being a feasible means of grade separation.  Nonetheless, the existence of this agreement obligates CN to bear a more significant cost apportionment for the present project.  The negotiated settlement reflects the change from an overhead bridge to an underpass due to land development as well as an expanded facility to accommodate five traffic lanes and two active transportation paths across the CN right-of-way. 2)An explanation, as well as the rational used, why the rail authority is not being required to pay for the grade separation as defined today, as the obligation was equally defined to be the financial responsibility of the rail authority in 1930’s, now in light of the fact that a legal agreement setting such a precedent exists in the case of the Waverley crossing; 3)And further provide an explanation why, when such an existing legal agreement is in favour of the rail authority and not the roads authority, the rail authority always ensures any settlement, in such a scenario would reflect said fact, and why the roads authority, in this case the City of Winnipeg, does not use the same legal and financial position to protect the ratepayers of Winnipeg.</td>

                    <p>This visualization of the 2016-12-14 Winnipeg City Council Disposition was created by <a href="http://opendemocracymanitoba.ca">Open Democracy Manitoba</a> using information from the <a href="http://data.winnipeg.ca">Winnipeg.ca Open Data Portal</a>.
                    <p>Dispositions are prepared by the City Clerks' Department using Microsoft Word. Tables are used in the Word Dispositions to structure the council meeting information. Word Dispositions are retrieved by Open Democracy Manitoba from the Winnipeg Open Data Portal and converted, first into JSON (a structured data format) and then into webpages like this one.</p>
