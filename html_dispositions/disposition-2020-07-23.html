                    <p>This visualization of the 2020-07-23 Winnipeg City Council Disposition was created by <a href="http://opendemocracymanitoba.ca">Open Democracy Manitoba</a> using information from the <a href="http://data.winnipeg.ca">Winnipeg.ca Open Data Portal</a>.
                    <p>Dispositions are prepared by the City Clerks' Department using Microsoft Word. Tables are used in the Word Dispositions to structure the council meeting information. Word Dispositions are retrieved by Open Democracy Manitoba from the Winnipeg Open Data Portal and converted, first into JSON (a structured data format) and then into webpages like this one.</p>
